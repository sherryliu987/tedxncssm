    <h1>About NCSSM</h1>

    <div id="ncssm">
        <p style="float:left">Unique in the UNC System, North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics is a
            world-class public high school
        with statewide reach, empowering students with the skills and knowledge to design their own future. Specializing in science, technology, engineering, and math — and with a robust humanities and arts program — NCSSM challenges talented high school juniors and seniors from across NC through a residential program on its historic campus in Durham and, soon, on a second campus being built in Morganton. The extensive online program and summer offerings extend the school’s impact to every corner of North Carolina. Founded in 1980 as the first of its kind, NCSSM has become the model for 18 such specialized schools around the globe.

    <h1>About the event</h1>
    <div style="display:flex">

    <p >TEDx Youth@NCSSM is a program designed to challenge and encourage people of all ages to
    engage and
    learn
        about
        some of the world’s biggest ideas. This year, we will coalesce around the theme “Uncharted”, seeking
        to highlight how probing the unknown can uncover new insights and experiences. Organized by a team of
        students at the
        North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, this event has been long in the works to bring you a
        stimulating virtual experience, and is open to all to attend and stretch your brains and learn beyond what one
        can
        expect.
