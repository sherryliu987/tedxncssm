In her spare time, she enjoys YA novels, world travel, swimming, and wrestling. In the future, Esha hopes to pursue studies in neuroscience, focusing on neurodegenerative disorders and diseases and traumatic brain injuries. However, she also seeks to explore her interest in self-confidence and self-motivation. It is her belief that every person should feel good about themselves, and not let their self-consciousness stop them from pursuing their dreams.</p>

            <h5>Jenevieve Surkin</h5>
            <p>is a sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she is exploring her love of Mandarin and majoring in biomedical engineering (BME) through the joint program between UNC and NC State. She is an alumni of the North Carolina School of Science and Math online program where she discovered her insatiable curiosity for the unknown. Conflict and compromise has been a part of human nature that has perpetually fascinated and perplexed Jenevieve on both a global and personal level. She strives to understand everyone and everything, to embrace differences in perspective and experience and learn from others. Her favorite area in BME thus far is neuroprosthetics, but she is also very interested in other areas of wearable tech, especially in Anouk Wipprecht’s fashion technology work on an ADHD detection headband, otherwise known as "Magical Unicorn Horn," to diagnose and provide a more specialized treatment plan for people with ADHD. Jenevieve has been learning Mandarin since she was six years old and her love of the language has led her to discover biomedical engineering in a global health setting where the counterintuitive competitive nature of science hinders its accessibility and progress. In her free time, Jenevieve is also a major dog-lover, trekkie, chocolate connoisseur, aspiring poet, avid reader, and robotics fanatic.</p>

            <p style="color:black">graduated from NCSSM’s online program in the class of 2019 and is now an Honors student at UNC Chapel Hill studying computer science, cognitive science and studio arts. She has managed projects that intersect in the technological, business, artistic and medical spheres while navigating the complexities and idiosyncrasies that each provides. Julianna is currently exploring applications of human-computer interaction in order to make everyday use of technology more intuitive for everyone.</p>
            <p style="color:black">The first TED event she attended was the 2018 TEDxYouth @NCSSM when the theme that year was growth. She was incredibly inspired by the speakers’ experiences, the audience’s discussions and the organizers’ dedication to bringing the spirit of TED to the NCSSM and NC community. For this year’s TEDxYouth@NCSSM event, she finds that these attributes have only grown to surpass the challenges of 2020 and the potential for greatness in 2021.</p>
